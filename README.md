##Word Guesser Using Genetic Algorithm

This is a simple Python program that guesses a target word using a basic Genetic Algorithm (GA).

##How it works:

Initializes a random population of guesses.

Uses mutation and crossover to evolve guesses over generations.

Tracks the best guess based on character matches with the target word.

Continues until the target word is guessed or max generations are reached.

##How to run:

python word_guesser.py


Enter a word and watch the GA try to guess it!

##Configurable parameters:

population – size of the guess population

mutation_rate – chance of a character mutating

crossover_rate – chance of combining two best guesses
