# Word Guesser Using Genetic Algorithm

A simple Python program that guesses a target word using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**.

## How it works
- Starts with a random population of guesses.
- Evolves guesses over generations using **mutation** and **crossover**.
- Tracks the **best guess** based on character matches with the target word.
- Continues until the target word is guessed or the maximum generations are reached.

## How to run
```bash
```
